# AI Agent Templates

A comprehensive collection of templates and components for building sophisticated AI agents and systems. This project provides modular building blocks for developers to create, deploy, and scale AI agents across various use cases.

## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains ready-to-use templates for the core components of AI agent systems:

- **Execution Environment**: Foundation for running AI agents with memory management and tool integration
- **Web Server**: FastAPI-based server for exposing agent capabilities as APIs
- **Message Brokers**: Integration templates for communication between agent components

## 🧩 Components

### Execution Environment

The core runtime for AI agents with features like:
- Modular agent architecture
- Flexible memory systems 
- Tool/skill integration framework
- Powerful code analysis capabilities

### Web Server

RESTful API service that:
- Provides endpoints for agent interaction
- Handles authentication and request validation
- Scales to support multiple concurrent users

### Message Brokers

Communication templates for:
- Redis-based messaging between components
- Asynchronous task processing
- Event-driven agent architectures

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each component includes its own README with detailed setup instructions. To get started:

1. Clone this repository
2. Choose the components you need for your agent system
3. Follow the setup instructions in each component directory
4. Customize the templates to your specific use case

## 💻 Example Use Cases

- **Code Analysis Agent**: Analyze code quality, suggest improvements, and track changes
- **Research Assistant**: Web scraping, document summarization, and knowledge graph building
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Transform, analyze, and visualize data from various sources
